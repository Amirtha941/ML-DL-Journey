> *“Everytime I say I'm building from scratch, I'm one step moving forward to the final deployment. I don't just copy and outsource; I learn, debug, and try to code algorithms.”* – Amirtha K

## 🎯 About the Repository

This repository documents my **project-based learning journey in ML & DL**:  

- I **pick one project at a time**  
- I use **YouTube tutorials and AI tools** to guide me, but I **learn the code, concepts, and algorithms thoroughly**  
- I **debug, experiment, and code from scratch**  
- I share **everything I learn** as **.md or .txt notes**, and **upload notebooks** once a project is complete  
- Goal: Build **portfolio-ready projects** from scratch, eventually deploying them

## 📌 Learning Philosophy

- **Project-based**: Focus on building and completing one project fully before starting the next  
- **From scratch**: Every line of code is **understood and debugged**  
- **Concept-first**: Learn the algorithm or concept behind every piece of code  
- **Documentation**: Share learning notes to solidify knowledge and help others  
- **Deployment-ready**: Every project moves one step closer to deployment
